In this paper, we explore in which ways climate networks are distorted due to false and missing edges. We find several mechanisms through which finite-sample noise can systematically distort climate networks. We also find that common resampling procedures to quantify significant behaviour in climate networks do not adequately capture intrinsic network variance. While we propose a new resampling framework, the question of how to reliably quantify intrinsic network variance from complex climatic time series remains a matter of ongoing work.
